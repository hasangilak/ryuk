# Phase 5: Plot Consistency & Validation

## Overview
Implements Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and topological sorting to ensure plot consistency. Three-tier validation system catches errors at structural, semantic, and style levels.

## Key Components
- CSP solver for plot consistency
- Kahn's algorithm for event ordering
- Three-tier validation (structural/semantic/style)
- Causal chain tracking
- Circular dependency detection
- Character knowledge consistency validation

## Dependencies
- Complete character state management
- Manga narrative structures
- Bidirectional relationships
- Temporal modeling framework
