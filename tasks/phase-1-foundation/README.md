# Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

## Overview

This phase establishes the fundamental infrastructure required for the AI-powered manga generation system. It focuses on setting up the core database layer, essential data models, and development environment necessary for all subsequent phases.

## Objectives

- Set up Neo4j graph database as the primary data store
- Define core data models and node types for narrative elements
- Establish basic graph schema and relationships
- Configure development environment for graph database operations
- Create foundational property graph structure
- Implement basic CRUD operations for core entities

## Key Components

### 1. Database Infrastructure
- Neo4j installation and configuration
- Database connection management
- Basic security and authentication setup
- Performance tuning for narrative workloads

### 2. Core Data Models
Implementation of the six primary node types identified in the base documentation:
- **Scene**: Individual story moments with metadata
- **Character**: Persistent entities with attributes and states
- **Choice**: Decision points in the narrative flow
- **Event**: Causal story elements with dependencies
- **Location**: Setting information with spatial relationships
- **Item**: Objects that can affect story progression

### 3. Basic Relationships
Initial relationship types for connecting entities:
- `LEADS_TO`: Sequential progression between scenes/choices
- `APPEARS_IN`: Character presence in scenes/events
- `TRIGGERS`: Causal relationships between events
- `REQUIRES`: Dependencies and prerequisites
- `LOCATED_AT`: Spatial relationships for scenes/characters/items

### 4. Schema Validation
- Property constraints for data integrity
- Relationship cardinality rules
- Index creation for performance optimization

## Dependencies

- Neo4j 4.4+ (Community or Enterprise)
- Neo4j driver for chosen programming language
- Development environment with graph visualization tools (Neo4j Browser/Desktop)

## Success Criteria

- [x] Neo4j database running and accessible
- [x] All core node types defined with properties
- [x] Basic relationships established and validated
- [x] CRUD operations working for all entities
- [x] Database schema documented
- [x] Connection pooling and error handling implemented
- [x] Initial performance benchmarks established

**Phase 1 Status: âœ… COMPLETED**

## Deliverables

1. Database setup scripts and configuration
2. Core data model definitions
3. Basic relationship schema
4. Connection management utilities
5. Documentation for database structure
6. Unit tests for data access layer

## Next Phase Dependencies

Phase 2 (Story Graph) requires:
- Functional Neo4j instance
- Core node types (Scene, Character, Choice, Event, Location, Item)
- Basic relationships (LEADS_TO, APPEARS_IN, TRIGGERS, REQUIRES)
- Working CRUD operations

## Estimated Timeline

**2-3 weeks** for a team of 2-3 developers with graph database experience.

## Risk Factors

- Neo4j learning curve for team members
- Schema design decisions affecting future scalability
- Performance tuning complexity for large narrative graphs
- Integration challenges with existing development workflow
