# Phase 4: Character & State Management

## Overview
Implements sophisticated character state management using Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HFSMs) and pushdown automata patterns. Supports complex character behaviors spanning multiple story branches with temporal character states and consistency tracking.

## Key Components
- Hierarchical Finite State Machines for character behavior
- Pushdown automata for temporary state excursions
- Temporal character state versioning
- Character persistence templates for AI integration
- Visual anchor system for consistency
- Multi-branch character development tracking

## Dependencies
- Phase 3 manga narrative structures
- Character supernode architecture
- Bidirectional relationship modeling
- Multi-resolution temporal framework
