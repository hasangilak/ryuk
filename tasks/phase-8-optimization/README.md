- Redis caching layer with TTL-based expiration
- Incremental validation for large narratives
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Memory usage optimization
- Capacity planning and scaling procedures

## Dependencies
- Complete system integration
- All core subsystems operational
- Performance monitoring infrastructure
