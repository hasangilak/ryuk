# Phase 3: Manga Narrative Structures

## Overview

This phase implements the specialized narrative structures unique to manga storytelling traditions. Building on the graph architecture from Phase 2, this phase adapts the system to support Japanese narrative patterns that fundamentally differ from Western storytelling conventions, requiring purpose-built computational models.

## Objectives

- Implement Kishōtenketsu four-act structure (ki-shō-ten-ketsu)
- Create jo-ha-kyū multi-resolution pacing system
- Build character network topology patterns specific to manga genres
- Implement Scott McCloud's panel transition taxonomy with manga-specific extensions
- Support aspect-to-aspect transitions for mood and atmosphere exploration
- Create non-linear dependency graphs for revelatory twist management
- Establish fractal pacing structures across multiple narrative scales

## Key Components

### 1. Kishōtenketsu Structure Implementation
The four-act Japanese narrative structure that doesn't rely on conflict:
- **Ki (Introduction)**: Setup and character establishment
- **Shō (Development)**: Situation development and character interaction
- **Ten (Twist)**: Unexpected revelation that recontextualizes earlier events
- **Ketsu (Conclusion)**: Resolution incorporating the new understanding

### 2. Jo-Ha-Kyū Pacing System
Nested rhythmic structures that operate at multiple scales:
- **Jo (Slow Introduction)**: Gradual buildup and establishment
- **Ha (Rapid Development)**: Acceleration and complication
- **Kyū (Swift Climax)**: Quick resolution and conclusion

### 3. Character Network Patterns
Genre-specific character relationship topologies:
- **Shōnen Networks**: Progressive densification with protagonist-centered structures
- **Shōjo Networks**: Sparse, intimate relationship graphs
- **Small-world Properties**: Secondary characters connecting through main characters

### 4. Panel Transition Systems
Manga-specific visual storytelling transitions:
- **Aspect-to-Aspect**: Exploring different facets of scene/mood
- **Moment-to-Moment**: Subtle progression within single scenes
- **Action-to-Action**: Traditional sequential progression
- **Subject-to-Subject**: Scene changes staying within same idea
- **Scene-to-Scene**: Significant transitions across distances
- **Non-sequitur**: No logical relationship

### 5. Bidirectional Relationship Modeling
Support for revelatory twists that alter meaning of earlier events:
- Retroactive semantic modification
- Timeline recontextualization
- Character perception shifts
- Plot revelation propagation

## Dependencies

**Phase 2 Requirements:**
- Functional hierarchical container system (Story/Knot/Stitch/Content)
- Character supernode architecture
- Advanced relationship modeling
- Graph traversal optimization
- Non-linear narrative pattern support

**Additional Dependencies:**
- Temporal modeling capabilities
- Multi-resolution data structures
- Bidirectional graph relationships
- Genre classification system
- Visual transition metadata support

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Kishōtenketsu structure properly modeled and validated
- [ ] Jo-ha-kyū pacing system working at multiple scales
- [ ] Genre-specific character networks correctly implemented
- [ ] Panel transition taxonomy fully supported
- [ ] Aspect-to-aspect transitions enable mood exploration
- [ ] Bidirectional relationships support revelatory storytelling
- [ ] Multi-resolution temporal modeling functional
- [ ] Fractal pacing structures operational

## Deliverables

1. Kishōtenketsu narrative structure implementation
2. Jo-ha-kyū multi-scale pacing system
3. Genre-specific character network patterns
4. Complete panel transition taxonomy
5. Bidirectional relationship system for plot revelations
6. Multi-resolution temporal modeling framework
7. Manga-specific validation rules
8. Genre classification and analysis tools

## Next Phase Dependencies

Phase 4 (Character State) requires:
- Kishōtenketsu structure for character development patterns
- Jo-ha-kyū pacing for character state transitions
- Character network patterns for relationship modeling
- Bidirectional relationships for character revelation management

## Estimated Timeline

**4-5 weeks** for a team of 2-3 developers with manga storytelling knowledge and temporal modeling experience.

## Risk Factors

- Complex temporal modeling for multi-resolution pacing
- Bidirectional relationship implementation complexity
- Cultural knowledge requirements for authentic manga patterns
- Performance optimization for complex narrative structures
- Integration challenges with existing graph architecture
- Validation complexity for non-Western narrative patterns
