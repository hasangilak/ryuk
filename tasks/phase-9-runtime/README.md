# Phase 9: Runtime & Execution

## Overview
Implements stack-based virtual machine inspired by Ink's runtime architecture. Handles JSON serialization, save/load systems, and external function bindings.

## Key Components
- Stack-based virtual machine for narrative execution
- JSON Graph Format (JGF) serialization
- Save/load system with rollback mechanisms
- External function bindings for AI integration
- Container/Content/Control command architecture
- Performance-optimized execution engine

## Dependencies
- Optimized system performance
- Complete AI integration
- Validated plot consistency
- All narrative structures implemented
